## Calculator App
=========

### About
An application for a calculator using the 4 basic mathematic operators (+, -, *, /) written in HTML/CSS/JavaScript and the jQuery library.

### Tools used

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. jQuery

### Goals for this project

1. Obtain better understanding of JavaScript and learn basic jQuery techniques.
2. Practice solving some common issues of designing a web application.
3. Learn CSS styling tricks.
4. Try to become familiar with JavaScript/jQuery interactions with the HTML and CSS
5. Predicting "dumb" users from entering mathematical statements that don't make sense and preventing them from doing so.

### Process

The idea for this project was to learn how jQuery interacts with the structure of the page and how to target specific elements in the page. After designing the calculator and successfully allowing the user to interact with the page, the next challenge was to prevent the user from entering illogical mathematical equations. Some sample statements to prevent were the input of more than one operator after another (3+++3, 3*/+-2). The final challenge was to find a function to compute the actual equation which was done with the JavaScript eval() function.

### Lessons learned

1. How to structure a web application with HTML.
2. How to organize and control the position of elements in a web page with CSS.
3. Using jQuery to make an interactive web by responding to user input (clicking).
4. Targeting specific elements in the DOM tree
5. Updating CSS styling with jQuery.

### Extensions for the future

1. Design the calculator into a more professional-looking calculator by possibly adding some opacity, animations, or just an entire redesign of the look of the calculator. 
2. Add the memory buttons (MC, MR, M+, M-) for the user to recall previous values
3. Add the "(" ")" precedence operators and implement their functionality.
4. Advance the calculator to be able to perform higher level mathematical computations.
